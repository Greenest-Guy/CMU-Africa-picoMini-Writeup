## Crack the Power
**Category:** Cryptography

**Files/Links Provided:** ```message.txt```


**Description:**  

```
We received an encrypted message. The modulus is built from primes large enough that factoring them isn‚Äôt an option, at least not today. See if you can make sense of the numbers and reveal the flag. Download the message.
```

**Steps to Solve:**  
1. Download ```message.txt```
2. Extract n, c, and e for analysis.
3. Check if the ciphertext corresponds to an exact integer e-th power. If the plaintext $$m$$ satisfies $$m^e < n$$, then $$m^e = c$$. Now you can recover $$m$$ by taking the e-th root of the ciphertext:
   
$$
m = \sqrt[e]{c}
$$

4. Use a python script to calculate $$m = \sqrt[e]{c}$$ and convert the bytes to plaintext.


**Code / Commands / Images**
```bash
import gmpy2

# modulus & ciphertext redacted
n = (modulus)
c = (ciphertext)
e = 20

m, exact = gmpy2.iroot(c, e)

if exact:
    plaintext_bytes = m.to_bytes((m.bit_length() + 7) // 8, byteorder='big')
    plaintext = plaintext_bytes.decode('utf-8')

    print(plaintext)
```

## Log Hunt
**Category:** General Skills

**Files/Links Provided:** ```server.log```


**Description:**  

```
Our server seems to be leaking pieces of a secret flag in its logs.
The parts are scattered and sometimes repeated. Can you reconstruct the original flag?
Download the logs and figure out the full flag from the fragments.
```

**Steps to Solve:**  
1. Download ```server.log```.
2. Open a terminal within the directory of the log files location.
3. Use grep to find the flag parts.
4. Reconstruct the flag using the flag parts.


**Code / Commands / Images**
```bash
grep "picoCTF" server.log -i
grep "INFO FLAGPART:" server.log -A 1 
```

## Crack the Gate 1
**Category:** Web Exploitation

**Files/Links Provided:** ```website```


**Description:**  

```
We‚Äôre in the middle of an investigation. One of our persons of interest, ctf player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal. We‚Äôve uncovered the email address he uses to log in: ctf-player@picoctf.org. Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt know the password, and the usual guessing techniques haven‚Äôt worked. But something feels off... it‚Äôs almost like the developer left a secret way in. Can you figure it out?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance
```

**Steps to Solve:**  
1. Open the website and inspect the index HTML file.
2. Decode a comment left by the developer within the index using ROT13 (Caesar Cipher)
3. Recover the temporary bypass header from the comment decoded from ROT13.
4. Open the website within Burp Suite's PortSwigger, turning on Proxy Intercepts after connecting.
5. Input the email provided in the description and any password.
6. Add the bypass header to the login HTTP request.
7. Forward the login request to the website, uncovering the flag.


**Code / Commands / Images**
```Python
def rot13(text):
    result = ""

    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            upper = char.isupper()
            num = ((ord(char.upper()) - 65) + 13) % 26
            new_char = chr(num + 65)

            if not upper:
                new_char = new_char.lower()

            result += new_char

        else:
            result += char

    return result

```

## Crack the Gate 2
**Category:** Web Exploitation

**Files/Links Provided:** ```website```, ```passwords.txt```


**Description:**  

```
The login system has been upgraded with a basic rate-limiting mechanism that locks out repeated failed attempts from the same source. We‚Äôve received a tip that the system might still trust user-controlled headers. Your objective is to bypass the rate-limiting restriction and log in using the known email address: ctf-player@picoctf.org and uncover the hidden secret.
```

**Steps to Solve:**  
1. Open the website within Burp Suite's PortSwigger, turning on Proxy Intercepts after connecting.
2. Input the known email, and a password from ```passwords.txt```.
3. Append ```X-Forwarded-For: <ipv4>``` to the top of your HTTP request with a random ip address.
4. Forward the edited HTTP request.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each password in ```passwords.txt``` with a different ip for each login attempt.

## Hidden in plainsight
**Category:** Forensics

**Files/Links Provided:** ```img.jpg```


**Description:**  

```
You‚Äôre given a seemingly ordinary JPG image. Something is tucked away out of sight inside the file. Your task is to discover the hidden payload and extract the flag. Download the jpg image here.
```

**Steps to Solve:**  
1. Download ```img.jpg```
2. Use ExifTool to read the metadata of ```img.jpg``` and save it to ```metadata.txt```.
3. Decode the comment ```c3RlZ2hpZGU6Y0VGNmVuZHZjbVE9``` within the metadata using Base64 returning ```steghide:cEF6endvcmQ=```.
4. Decode ```cEF6endvcmQ=``` using Base64 again returning ```pAzzword```.
5. Use steghide along with the password to get the flag.


**Code / Commands / Images**
```bash
base64 -d file.txt
steghide extract -sf img.jpg -p pAzzword
```

## Corrupted file
**Category:** Forensics

**Files/Links Provided:** ```file```


**Description:**  

```
This file seems broken... or is it? Maybe a couple of bytes could make all the difference. Can you figure out how to bring it back to life? Download the file here.
```

**Steps to Solve:**  
1. Download ```file```
2. Use xxd to inspect the hexdump of the file.
3. Compare the first 16 bytes of the corrupted file to a working jpg.
4. Save the xxd into a hexdump file, opening it in a text editor.
5. Repair the file by changing the first nibble (4 bits) to ```ffd8``` which is part of the file signature (header) of a jpg file.
6. Save the file and change it to a ```.jpg```.

**Code / Commands / Images**
![image](https://github.com/Greenest-Guy/picoMini-CMU-Africa-CTF-Writeup/blob/main/images/compare.png)
```bash
xxd file > filedump
xxd -r filedump > file
mv file file.jpg
```

## Input Injection 1
**Category:** Binary Exploitation

**Files/Links Provided:** ```vuln.c```, ```vuln```


**Description:**  

```
A friendly program wants to greet you‚Ä¶ but its goodbye might say more than it should. Can you convince it to reveal the flag?
```

**Steps to Solve:**  
1. Download ```vuln.c``` and open in a text editor.
2. ```fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin)``` allows for up to 199 bytes of input but ```fun()``` copies the input using ```strcpy() (no bounds checking)``` into buffer which is 10 bytes, so an input >10 bytes will overflow buffer.
3. Connect to the challenge instance ```nc <host> <port>```.
4. Try a test input which reveals that ```system()``` is executed with the command ```uname```, which outputs Linux, the host's OS.
5. Using an input such as ```0123456789echo "injection"``` echos injection to the terminal, verifying the vulnerability.
6. Reconnect to the server then input ```0123456789ls``` which reveals ```flag.txt```.
7. Finally, after using the input ```0123456789cat flag.txt``` the flag will be displayed in the terminal.

**Code / Commands / Images**

```c
// vuln.c source code
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> 

void fun(char *name, char *cmd);

int main() {
    char name[200];
    printf("What is your name?\n");
    fflush(stdout);


    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
    name[strcspn(name, "\n")] = 0;

    fun(name, "uname");
    return 0;
}

void fun(char *name, char *cmd) {
    char c[10];
    char buffer[10];

    strcpy(c, cmd);
    strcpy(buffer, name);

    printf("Goodbye, %s!\n", buffer);
    fflush(stdout);
    system(c);
}

```
