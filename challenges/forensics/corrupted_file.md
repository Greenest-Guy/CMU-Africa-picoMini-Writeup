## 🔍 Corrupted file
**Category:** Forensics

**Files/Links Provided:** ```file```


**Description:**  

```
This file seems broken... or is it? Maybe a couple of bytes
could make all the difference. Can you figure out how to bring
it back to life? Download the file here.
```

**Steps to Solve:**  
1. Download ```file```
2. Use xxd to inspect the hexdump of the file.
3. Compare the first 16 bytes of the corrupted file to a working jpg.
4. Save the xxd into a hexdump file, opening it in a text editor.
5. Repair the file by changing the first nibble (4 bits) to ```ffd8``` which is part of the file signature (header) of a jpg file.
6. Save the file and change it to a ```.jpg```.
