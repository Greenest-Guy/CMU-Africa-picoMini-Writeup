## Crack the Gate 1
**Category:** Web Exploitation

**Files/Links Provided:** ```website```


**Description:**  

```
Weâ€™re in the middle of an investigation. One of our persons of interest,
ctf player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal.
Weâ€™ve uncovered the email address he uses to log in: ctf-player@picoctf.org.
Unfortunately, we donâ€™t know the password, and the usual guessing techniques
havenâ€™t worked. But something feels off... itâ€™s almost like the developer left
a secret way in. Can you figure it out?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance
```

**Steps to Solve:**  
1. Open the website and inspect the index HTML file.
2. Decode a comment left by the developer within the index using ROT13 (Caesar Cipher)
3. Recover the temporary bypass header from the comment decoded from ROT13.
4. Open the website within Burp Suite's PortSwigger, turning on Proxy Intercepts after connecting.
5. Input the email provided in the description and any password.
6. Add the bypass header to the login HTTP request.
7. Forward the login request to the website, uncovering the flag.


**Code / Commands / Images**
```Python
def rot13(text):
    result = ""

    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            upper = char.isupper()
            num = ((ord(char.upper()) - 65) + 13) % 26
            new_char = chr(num + 65)

            if not upper:
                new_char = new_char.lower()

            result += new_char

        else:
            result += char

    return result

```
