## üåê Crack the Gate 2
**Category:** Web Exploitation

**Files/Links Provided:** ```website```, ```passwords.txt```


**Description:**  

```
The login system has been upgraded with a basic rate-limiting
mechanism that locks out repeated failed attempts from the same source.
We‚Äôve received a tip that the system might still trust user-controlled headers.
Your objective is to bypass the rate-limiting restriction and log in using the
known email address: ctf-player@picoctf.org and uncover the hidden secret.
```

**Steps to Solve:**  
1. Open the website within Burp Suite's PortSwigger, turning on Proxy Intercepts after connecting.
2. Input the known email, and a password from ```passwords.txt```.
3. Append ```X-Forwarded-For: <ipv4>``` to the top of your HTTP request with a random ip address.
4. Forward the edited HTTP request.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each password in ```passwords.txt``` with a different ip for each login attempt.
